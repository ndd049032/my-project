Python Algorithms and Projects

This project showcases a variety of algorithms and practical programming exercises that I have
worked on to enhance my Python skills. It includes implementations of classic algorithms such as
Bubble Sort, Binary Search, as well as web scraping examples and other algorithmic exercises.

Key Features

Sorting Algorithms:
Bubble Sort: Implemented with real-time visualization to show the sorting process.
Search Algorithms:
Binary Search: Efficient search for the closest number in a sorted list.
Web Scraping:
Web scraping of products or other data from a website using Python (e.g., extracting product prices, availability, etc.).

Technologies Used
Python
Selenium (for web scraping)
Matplotlib (for visualizations)
unittest (for testing)
Other relevant libraries
